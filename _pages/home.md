We are a research group at the [Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas da USP](https://www.iag.usp.br/). Our aim is to explore and understand the history of the formation of our Galaxy.

From the dynamical and chemical properties of the stars we can rebuild the history of formation of our Galaxy. For more information on why and how (see [Research](research)).

We are located at [Universidade de São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/).
